# Movie-Recommender-System
As a part of B.Tech Project

The dataset which is used as a sample for this project can be found [here](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-20m.zip). 
GroupLens Research has collected and made available rating data sets from the MovieLens web site (http://movielens.org). 
The data sets were collected over various periods of time, depending on the size of the set. In order to run the project you need the csv 
files (i.e the sample dataset) which can be downloaded from the link provided above adn they need should be in the same package for every 
module.

Note : This is an ongoing project and the modules are still under testing phase. The integration of these modules is yet to be done.
